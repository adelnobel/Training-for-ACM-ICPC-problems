Training for ACM-ICPC problems  
=========   


This repository contains source codes for most of the problems I solved on online judges. 
Problems are categorised by their topics, each directory represents problems under a certain topic. 

Problems that involve multiple topics may be found in any of them. Most problems solutions are named in this format **[Online judge prefix]-[problem ID]-[problem name]**. You can easily get the link of a problem by googling its name and ID along with the corresponding online judge name.

#####Online judges include:#####

* **ICPC Live Archive [LA]**
* **UVA Online Judge [UVA]**
* **Spoj [spoj]**
* **TopCoder [topcoder]**
* **Codeforces [topcoder]**

Most of codeforces solutions are not present here because codeforces already keeps track of them. Find my account on codeforces ***adelnobel***
