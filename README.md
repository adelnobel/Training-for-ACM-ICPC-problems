Training for ACM-ICPC problems  
=========   


This repository contains source codes for most of the problems I solved on online judges. 
Problems are categorised by their topics, each directory represents problems under a certain topic. 

Problems that involve multiple topics may be found in any of them. Most problems solutions are named in this format **[Online judge prefix]-[problem ID]-[problem name]**. You can easily get the link of a problem by googling its name and ID along with the corresponding online judge name.
