First, we can decompose the formula from
(sqrt(a) + sqrt(b))^2

Into

a + 2*sqrt(a*b) + b  //The famous rule! („—»⁄ «·«Ê·° „—»⁄ «· «‰Ì° 2 ›Ì «·«Ê· ›Ì «· «‰Ì)

And then, what we need now is to find a value of a * b which is a square number!!
Meaning that if we take the square root of a*b we will get an integral value!! like 9, 25, 36, 49, etc...
These values only will guarantee an integral value as the result, because all other parts of the equations are integers!

Tip: a number is a square number, if each factor of its prime factors occurs EVEN times!!

Like 2 * 2 = 4 square number!

3 * 3 = 9, square number!

2 * 2 * 3 * 3 = 36 square number!!

now what we can do is to loop through all values of M
And for each value, we factorize it, and count how many times a factor occurs, if a factor occurs ODD times, then we need to balance this!

We want to get the twin of this number, a twin number is the number that when multiplied by the number results in a new number that has all
factors of the old number balanced!!

Example:
2 * 3 = 6
twin that balances the factors is 2 * 3
now we have  2 * 2 * 3 * 3 = 36 square number!

Example:

2 * 5 * 5  = 50
The twin will be 2 = 2
now we have 2 * 2 * 5 * 5 = 100 square number!

after we get the twin, we can make a loop over all square numbers UNDER N

we make a loop of j = 1; j * j <= N;

All these numbers are square numbers!! and can be added to the original value without any errors! because when we multiply original
i * twin * j*j we will surely get a square number whose factors are balanced!!

we check for each j*j * twin if its <= N, then we increment the counter
If bigger we break the inside loop!
