Problem on SPOJ
http://www.spoj.pl/problems/EDIST/


My explanation

This is a dynamic programming problem
First, we start with 2 strings, we pad each string from the left by a space ' '
so str1[0] = str2[0] = ' '

And then we initialize our 2D Array with edit distances values

What we know initially is, the edit distance between the first character of each string and the other string
the first character is the empty character (e epsilon)

so we initialize the first row and the first column with edit distances values (See the image)

And then; we loop for each row and initialize the value of each cell according to this equation

arr[a][b] = min( arr[a-1][b] + 1 , min( arr[a][b-1]+1, arr[a-1][b-1] + (str1[a] != str2[b] ) )

The expression (str1[a] != str2[b] ) will be equal to 1 if str1[a] DOESN'T EQUAL str2[b]
And hence we need to add cost 1, because there is a change
On the other hand, if str1[a] EQUALS str2[b] then the expression will evaluate to 0 (We don't need to make a change since they are equal)
